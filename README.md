# Sprint 13 Deliverables (Last Sprint!) 
In this final sprint, we added some fun features to our website. We included a text box that checks for any keywords that will trigger some fun visual effects. Also, we implemented a simple yet fun minigame in the sidebar if the user inputs the right trigger word. The game we chose to implement is Tic Tac Toe, where you can play against an AI. This minigame has a score counter, difficulty option, and light/dark mode. 
## Here is a screenshot of one of the trigger words, "snow"

With that, we conclude our Capstone project. Thank you!
