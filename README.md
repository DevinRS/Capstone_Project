# Sprint 7 Deliverables 
For this sprint, we connected the user authentication backend and frontend. For this goal, we also completed our home page that serves the capabilities for user authentication such as login, create account, forgot password, forgot username, edit profile, etc. We unfortunately were not able to finish the rest of the linking, specifically the community cloud page. Next, we optimize our app by removing ydata-profiling library and create a similar functionality from the ground up to increase speed. For processes that can't be speed up, we added a loader animation for the user. We moved the profiling functionality to the pathfinder page and keep the autodidact page only for training and deployment of models for accessibility.

Here is the home page of our app when user is logged in

Here is the email that was sent for "Forgot Username" functionality. It was sent through the app ("Forgot Password" has the same format)
