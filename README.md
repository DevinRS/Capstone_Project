# Sprint 5 Deliverables 
For this sprint, the files are available in /backend_app/. New auth.py is added that contain the class for authentication purposes with JWT. Edited main.py to add authentication endpoints (register, login, unprotected, protected)

Here's what each endpoint does:
- /register: takes username and password and create a new user
- /login: takes username and password, authenticate, and generate JWT
- /unprotected: example of an unprotected endpoint that can be accessed without authentication
- /protected: example of a protected endpoint that needs JWT authorization
