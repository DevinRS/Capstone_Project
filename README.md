# Sprint 9 Deliverables 
For this sprint, we updated our database to add the necessary tables for our like and dislike features in the third page. In addition to that, we also implemented some API endpoints in FastAPI that makes these features possible. We have yet to link the front and backend of our websites for the like and dislike features, but it will be done next sprint. Aside from like and dislike, we also implemented our merit system for users, where a post gives you one merit, a like gives you anoter, and a dislike subtracts one. All of these actions have been included in our FastAPI.

Here are our new FastAPI endpoints, as well as our previously existing ones:
