Classification is a type of supervised learning where the machine learns from the data input given to it and then uses this learning to classify new observation. This algorithm is used to predict a discrete value. E.g. If an email is spam or not spam; If a tumor is malignant or benign.
             
Some common classification algorithms are:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
