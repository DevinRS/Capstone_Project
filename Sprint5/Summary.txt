For this sprint we all work on the backend together as we are unfamiliar with JWT.
We have successfully implemented the following:
  1. Password Hashing with HS256 algorithm
  2. JSON Web Token generation for login endpoint
  3. Protected endpoint to illustrate that the JWT is working and needed to execute protected endpoints
